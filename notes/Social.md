well folks...
I have - like many of you, I'm sure - been noodling on the general idea of writing a Mastodon/Fediverse primer for "regular people" (read: scrubs, like me,) for my whole time here, basically, but I feel like now is probably the time to put in the effort, if it's going to happen.

the thing is... while I know of/use so many services/utilities/methodologies that will improve a brand new user's experience *tremendously*, literally *all* of them came from *YOU*, smart people. I appreciate it more than ever, but I'm here to call on you again...

if you'd enjoy it... if you feel like it, I'd love it if you'd reply to this thread with those undercovered projects you know of (or perhaps have created yourself!) you wish you could make every new user aware of.

*and/or* just what you're using at this moment! (client, scripts, integration, etc.) I'm realizing I personally need a refresh on this subject lol.
 
or perhaps on this Reddit thread? 

(or perhaps on GitHub Discussions?? I literally have no idea how folks might be collaborating on stuff like this.

•	At first, not mandatory but recommended to understand the concept of the Fediverse and how Mastodon integrates with it : the Fediverse wiki. https://joinfediverse.wiki/Main_Page/Fancy
•	Then, to choose a server, there’s the JoinMastodon list https://joinmastodon.org/server , or FediDB that lists all servers from all softwares. https://fedidb.org/network
•	There’s the https://fedi.tips/ website which is a big FAQ about Fediverse in general, also exists as a Mastodon account. https://mstdn.social/@feditips
```

And finally, the most important step is to follow a lot of accounts to get an active timeline. There are some lists that could help :

```
•	https://fedi.directory/ / https://mastodon.online/@FediFollows
•	https://fediverse.info/
•	https://communitywiki.org/trunk
```
