# Eugen Rochko - *Uses This*

`April 26, 2019`

## Developer of Mastodon

**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I am Eugen Rochko, and I am the founder and developer of [Mastodon][1], a decentralized, open-source social network. I am 26 years old and I live in Germany. I have studied computer science and philosophy at a local university.

**What hardware do you use?**

I have a System76 [Lemur][2] laptop which I carry around, and an Acer [Predator G3-605][3] desktop. It has an Intel [Core i7-4790][4] CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA [GeForce GTX 760][5] graphics card with 1.5 GB memory. My monitor is a Samsung [LC24F390FHUXEN][6], a curved 24". Peripheral-wise, I have a mechanical Razer [Huntsman Elite][7] keyboard, a Razer [Mamba Elite][8] mouse on a Razer Goliathus Chroma mousepad, and Razer [Nommo Chroma][9] loudspeakers. The lights cheer me up.

Since I also dabble in music, I have some music gear connected to my desktop. I have a Superlux [E205][10] condenser microphone plugged into a Focusrite [Scarlett 2i4][11] USB audio interface together with my guitars.

**And what software?**

Many years ago I bought a license for [Sublime Text 3][12] and have been using it ever since. I don't use any IDEs, just a text editor. I primarily develop on [Ubuntu][13]. I use [Git][14] all the time. When I need to touch vector graphics, I use [Inkscape][15]. If I need to edit raster images, I use [GIMP][16].

**What would be your dream setup?**

I think I am very privileged to say that I already have my dream setup. Some of the hardware is from before Mastodon, some is quite old, but most of the fancy things came together quite recently around Christmas, and I couldn't be happier about it.
